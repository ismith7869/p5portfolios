<h1>&nbsp;Athlete</h1>
<p><span style="font-family: Pristina, Script; font-size: 20pt; padding-left: 0px;">&nbsp;I've always loved sports,</span>&nbsp;I love getting exercise and meeting new people and one way I do that is through sports, I've been playing sports my whole life I first played basketball, then volleyball, and now I play golf.</p>	  
<p>&nbsp;Golf is the newest sport I have picked up and decided to keep at it and play at the next level and potentially play in the LPGA. My mission is to bring awareness to the opportunities you can get playing golf especially as a minority, but it also comes with its challenges because there aren't many minority in golf and some people won't look at you as a good golfer they might look at you and only see you for your skin and I want to help change that.</p>

<h1> &nbsp;Artist</h1>
<p><span  style="font-family: Pristina, Script; font-size: 20pt;">&nbsp; Art is   a side hobby I love to do outside of sports and girl scouts,&nbsp;</span>I love art and drawing because it is a coping mechanism that I use to help deal with mental health issues and I also use as a stress release.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I love the feeeling of pencil to paper and looking at a finished piece that I can be happy with and show people my creative side. I started drawing inn 7th grade and haven't stoppped some of my favorite mediums to use are colored pencil, watercolor pencil, oil pastel, alcohol markers, and watercolor paint.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;Traveler</h1>
<p><span  style="font-family: Pristina, Script; font-size: 20pt;">&nbsp;I love traveling to different places,</span>&nbsp;one of the main reasons I love traveling is I love seeing different places and getting a change of scenery. I would love to travel the whole world going to places I've never been or even heard of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I also like hanging out with my family on vacation mostly because we have fun and we aren't worried about school, work, or bills. Were just having fun kind of just doing want we want to do and not planning out the day. A couple of my favorite places we've been are the mountains in Virginia, the mountains in North Carolina, and Orlando Florida.</p>
